Error: While constructing the build plan, the following exceptions were encountered:

In the dependencies for haxbase-1.0.0.3:
    text must match -any, but the stack configuration has no specified version (latest applicable is 1.2.2.1)
needed due to haxtatic-1.0.0.2 -> haxbase-1.0.0.3

Recommended action: try adding the following to your extra-deps in /home/rox/c/go/src/github.com/metaleap/ahs/haxtatic/stack.yaml:
- text-1.2.2.1
